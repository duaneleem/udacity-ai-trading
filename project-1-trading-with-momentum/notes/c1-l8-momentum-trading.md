## Disambiguation of the term “Alpha”
- In mathematics, you’ll see alpha refer to the significance level of a hypothesis test. 
- In regression, you’ll see alpha refer to the y-intercept of a straight line.
- In finance, alpha refers to multiple distinct but somewhat related ideas.
-  The common thread among these definitions is that alpha is the extra value that an investment professional can add to the performance of an investment. 
- Another specific definition of alpha, which we’ll primarily focus on in this course, is that of an alpha vector.
- An alpha vector is a list of numbers, one for each stock in a portfolio, that gives us a signal as to the relative future performance of these stocks.
