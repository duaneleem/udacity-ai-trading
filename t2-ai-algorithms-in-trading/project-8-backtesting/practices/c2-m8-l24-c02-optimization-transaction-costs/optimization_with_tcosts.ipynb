    "# Optimization with Transaction costs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we’ll show you how to incorporate transaction costs into portfolio optimization.  This will give your backtest a more realistic measure of your alpha’s performance.  In addition, we’ll show you some additional ways to design your optimization with efficiency in mind.  This is really helpful when  backtesting, because having reasonably shorter runtimes allows you to test and iterate on your alphas more quickly."

    "Note that the data fields that start with the prefix U-S-F-A-S-T are factor exposures, one column for each factor.  We will use some of these as alpha factors, and the rest as risk factors.  The reason this makes sense is that, for the time periods in which we’re back-testing, some of these factors were able to produce better than average returns.  Barra works with its clients (funds) and gathers information about alphas that worked in the past.  These were calculated on historical data to produce the factor exposure data found in the Barra data."

    "## Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a partial list of the barra factors in our dataset and their definitions.  These are collected from documentation by Barra.  There are style factors and industry factors.  The industry factors will be used as risk factors.  You can consider using the style factors as alpha factors.  Any factors not used as alpha factors can be included in the risk factors category.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Style factors\n",
    "* beta: Describes market risk that cannot be explained by the Country factor. The Beta factor is typically the most important style factor. We calculate Beta by time-series regression of stock excess returns against the market return.\n",
    "* 1 day reversal\n",
    "* dividend yield: Describes differences in stock returns attributable to stock's historical and predicted dividend-to-price ratios.\n",
    "* downside risk (maximum drawdown)\n",
    "* earnings quality:  Describes stock return differences due to the accrual components of earnings.\n",
    "* earnings yield: Describes return differences based on a company’s earnings relative to its price. Earnings Yield is considered by many investors to be a strong value signal. The most important descriptor in this factor is the analyst-predicted 12-month earnings-to-price ratio.\n",
    "* growth: Differentiates stocks based on their prospects for sales or earnings growth. The most important descriptor in this factor is the analyst predicted long-term earnings growth. Other descriptors include sales and earnings growth over the previous five years.\n",
    "* leverage: Describes return differences between high and low-leverage stocks. The descriptors within this style factor include market leverage, book leverage, and debt-to-assets ratio.\n",
    "* liquidity: Describes return differences due to relative trading activity. The descriptors for this factor are based on the fraction of total shares outstanding that trade over a recent window.\n",
    "* long-term reversal: Describes common variation in returns related to a long-term (five years ex. recent thirteen months) stock price behavior.\n",
    "* management quality\n",
    "* Mid capitalization: Describes non-linearity in the payoff to the Size factor across the market-cap spectrum. This factor is based on a single raw descriptor: the cube of the Size exposure. However, because this raw descriptor is highly collinear with the Size factor, it is orthogonalized with respect to Size. This procedure does not affect the fit of the model, but does mitigate the confounding effects of collinearity, while preserving an intuitive meaning for the Size factor. As described by Menchero (2010), the Mid Capitalization factor roughly captures the risk of a “barbell portfolio” that is long mid-cap stocks and short small-cap and large-cap stocks.\n",
    "* Momentum – Differentiates stocks based on their performance over the trailing 12 months. When computing Momentum exposures, we exclude the most recent returns in order to avoid the effects of short-term reversal. The Momentum factor is often the second strongest factor in the model, although sometimes it may surpass Beta in importance.\n",
    "* Profitability – Combines profitability measures that characterize efficiency of a firm's operations and total activities.\n",
    "* Residual Volatility – Measures the idiosyncratic volatility anomaly. It has three descriptors: (a) the volatility of daily excess returns, (b) the volatility of daily residual returns, and (c) the cumulative range of the stock over the last 12 months. Since these descriptors tend to be highly collinear with the Beta factor, the Residual Volatility factor is orthogonalized with respect to the Beta and Size factors.\n",
    "* seasonality\n",
    "* sentiment\n",
    "* Size – Represents a strong source of equity return covariance, and captures return differences between large-cap and small-cap stocks. We measure Size by the log of market capitalization.\n",
    "* Short term reversal\n",
    "* Value\n",
    "* Prospect -- is a function of skewness and maximum drawdown.\n",
    "* Management Quality -- is a function of the following: \n",
    "    * Asset Growth: Annual reported company assets are regressed against time over the past five fiscal years. The slope coefficient is then divided by the average annual assets to obtain the asset growth.\n",
    "    * Issuance Growth Annual reported company number of shares outstanding regressed against time over the past five fiscal years. The slope coefficient is then divided by the average annual number of shares outstanding.\n",
    "    * Capital Expenditure Growth: Annual reported company capital expenditures are regressed against time over the past five fiscal years. The slope coefficient is then divided by the average annual capital expenditures to obtain the capital expenditures growth.\n",
    "    * Capital Expenditure: The most recent capital expenditures are scaled by the average of capital expenditures over the last five fiscal years.\n",
